<h2 id= "What" >What is a Black Hole?</h2>
<p>Black holes are points in space that are so dense they create 
deep gravity sinks. Beyond a certain region, called the event horizon, not even light can
 escape the powerful pull of a black hole's gravity. 
  Anything that ventures too close will be stretched like putty in a 
 theoretical process  known as spaghettification.
 There are four types of black holes: stellar, intermediate, 
 supermassive, and miniature. The most common way for a black
 hole to form is by stellar death. As stars reach the end of 
 their lives, most will inflate, lose mass, and then cool to
 form white dwarfs. But the largest of the stars , 
 those at least 10 to 20 times as massive as our own sun, 
 are  to become either super-dense neutron stars or 
 stellar-mass black holes.</p>

<h2 id= "Time" >Time around a Black Hole</h2>
<p>As you get closer to a black hole, the flow of time slows down, compared to flow of time far from the hole. Earth's gravity is so weak that the slowing of time is not noticeable, but the effect has been confirmed using sensitive instruments. For example, at sea level you age one-billionth of a second less every year than you would if you lived on top of Mt. Everest. Near a black hole, the slowing of time is extreme. From the viewpoint of an observer outside the black hole, time stops. For example, an object falling into the hole would appear frozen in time at the edge of the hole.
</p>
<h2 id= "theory">Parts of a Black Hole</h2>
<p>Black holes have three layers. These layers are the outer and inner event horizon and the singularity. The event horizon of a black hole is the boundary around the mouth of the black hole where light loses its ability to escape. Once a particle crosses the event horizon, it cannot leave. Gravity is constant across the event horizon. The inner region of a black hole, where its mass lies, is known as its singularity, the single point in space-time where the mass of the black hole is concentrated. </p>

<ul>
<li>Miniature black holes may have formed immediately after the Big Bang </li>

<li>If your sun was replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the planets will continue to orbit exactly the same way</li>
<li>Astronomers estimate there are anywhere from 10 million to a billion stellar black holes, with masses roughly three times that of the sun, in the Milky Way</li>
<li>You canâ€™t directly see a black hole</li>
<li>Our Milky Way likely has a black hole</li>
<li>Carl Schwarzschild was the first to use Einstein's theory of general relativity to predict the point of no return for a black hole</li>
